TweenoUTFT
==========

A fork of henningkarlsen.com's UTFT library
This fork is simply just a modification to make the UTFT library support TweenoSTP image transfer.
It would appear that images sized 8x8px is not supported by the standard UTFT library.
Also the standard UTFT library only supports reading imagedata from PROGMEM.
